The repository we used contained a project where a flask application was used to establish a communication with open AI on any sort of research paper. 
Findings:
While doing this assignment, we came across a lot of things that made us understand a lot about Github Actions and Jenkins. Github Actions and Jenkins are two popular continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) tools used in software development. 
Github Actions is a cloud-based service provided by Github that enables developers to automate workflows, build and test code, and deploy applications. 
It is tightly integrated with Github and offers a simple, YAML-based syntax for defining workflows. 
On the other hand, Jenkins is a self-hosted, open-source CI/CD tool that offers more flexibility and customization options than Github Actions. It supports a wide range of plugins and integrations, and can be used to automate all aspects of the software development process, from building and testing code to deploying applications to multiple environments. 
Both Github Actions and Jenkins are widely used in the industry and offer a range of benefits to developers looking to streamline their development process.
